# Write a program that calculates the area of a square
# Write the formula: Length * Length
# Measure the length using a davice
# Ask the User for the length
# Calculate the area of the square using the formula(Length * Length)
# We are going to hardcode(opp is dynamic) values; No dynamic values
length = 4
# Calculate the area of the square using the formula(Length * Length)
area = length * length
print(area)
# Convert your program to accept user input for the length variable and use the
# input to compute the area of the square.

#First Python Assignment. Create a program that displays your name and complete
#mailing add formatted in an envelope address manner. Your program does not
#need to read any input from the user
